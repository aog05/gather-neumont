Neumont College of Computer Science: Brand Kit & Visual Style Guide
This brand kit integrates the technical visual standards you provided with the institutional identity and messaging found in the sources.
1. Core Identity & Mission
• Mission Statement: "Improving Lives Through Education".
• The Neumont Paradigm: A "Computer Science First" curricular model that prioritizes technical mastery from the first quarter of the freshman year.
• Value Proposition: High ROI (Return on Investment), characterized as the "best bang for your buck".
• Institutional Identity: Recognized as an "Opportunity College" for high student access and strong alumni earnings.
2. Visual Identity & Color Palette
The Neumont aesthetic is clean, high-tech, and professional, designed to mirror a corporate technology environment rather than a traditional academic one.
• Primary Colors:
    ◦ Neumont Yellow (#FFDD00): Used for primary text emphasis and call-to-action highlights.
    ◦ Neumont Grey (#1F1F1F): The foundational dark neutral used for backgrounds and primary UI elements.
• Iconography: Minimalistic and functional, supporting a "tech-first" navigation experience.
• Industrial Cues: Marketing and physical branding utilize high-tech elements, such as brochures delivered in "anti-static bags".
3. Typography Standards
The brand uses a modern, sans-serif typographic system to convey technical authority.
• Primary Typeface: Din 2014
• Header & Emphasis Typeface: DIN bold
• Stylistic Patterns:
    ◦ Acronym-First Headers: Major degree programs are always introduced by their bolded 4-letter acronyms (e.g., BSCS, BSAIE, BSGD).
    ◦ Technical Emphasis: Key competencies and "bleeding-edge" technologies are bolded within body paragraphs to draw attention to professional skills (e.g., "Object-oriented Programming," "Neural Networks," "Scalable Architecture").
4. Brand Tone & Voice
The Neumont voice is vocational, energetic, and inclusive.
• The "Llama" Persona: Uses relatable community terms like "Neubies" for freshmen and "Full-fledged Neumont Llama" for established students.
• Action-Oriented: Employs direct commands such as "Hit the ground running," "Launch your career," and "Master technology".
• Community-Focused: Emphasizes that "Everyone here is just like you," creating a safe and welcoming space for tech-minded individuals.
5. The Neumont Lexicon
Specific terminology used to define the unique student experience:
• Sprints: 10-week academic quarters that mimic a professional work week.
• FReX (Freshman Experience): The signature accepted-student event.
• Enterprise Projects: Immersive externships (up to 20 hours a week) where students solve technical challenges for real companies like IBM, Nike, and Bosch.
• Silicon Slopes: The college's geographical identity as a tech hub in Utah.
6. Pedagogical Framework
Messaging regarding education must revolve around the Five Phases of Project-Based Learning (PBL):
1. Introductory: Mastering project team methodologies and foundations.
2. Foundational: Small-scale lab projects paired with core tech courses.
3. Developmental: Integrating complex projects (e.g., game engines, security models) into every course.
4. Capstone: A required individual "masterwork" demonstrating technical self-reliance.
5. Enterprise: Professional industry experience solving real-world corporate challenges.
