Neumont College of Computer Science: Brand Kit & Style Guide
1. Core Identity & Mission
• Mission Statement: "Improving Lives Through Education".
• The Neumont Paradigm: A "Computer Science First" philosophy that prioritizes technical mastery from day one, rather than waiting until the junior year.
• Value Proposition: High ROI (Return on Investment), famously described as the "best bang for your buck".
• Location Identity: Nestled in the center of "Silicon Slopes" in Salt Lake City, Utah.
2. Brand Tone & Voice
The Neumont voice is technical, energetic, vocational, and inclusive. It is designed to resonate with "tech innovators" and "problem solvers".
• Vocational Focus: Uses active, career-oriented language such as "hit the ground running," "career-ready," and "proven credentials".
• Inclusive & Relatable: Uses community-focused messaging like "Everyone here is just like you," and "your inclusive home away from home".
• Bold & Direct: Employs commands like "Learn to master technology" and "Launch your career".
3. The Neumont Lexicon
The brand uses specialized terminology to describe its unique academic structure:
• The Neumont Llama: The official mascot and student identity (e.g., "full-fledged Neumont Llama").
• Sprints: 10-week academic quarters that mimic the professional work week.
• Neubies: A term for incoming freshman students.
• Enterprise Projects: Immersive externships where student teams work for real companies like IBM, Nike, and Bosch.
• FReX (Freshman Experience): The signature accepted-student event.
4. Visual Identity & Hierarchy
Based on official materials, the brand follows a technical and structured visual style:
• Typography Patterns:
    ◦ Acronym-First Headers: Degrees are always introduced by their bolded 4-letter acronyms (e.g., BSCS, BSAIE, BSGD).
    ◦ High Emphasis: Key skills and outcomes are bolded within text to draw the eye to technical competencies (e.g., "Object-oriented Programming," "Neural Networks").
• Aesthetic Cues:
    ◦ Industrial Tech: Marketing materials utilize high-tech imagery, such as delivery in "anti-static bags".
    ◦ Gaming Heritage: Strong visual association with the Neumont Game Studio and titles published on Steam.
5. Degree Program Messaging
Each degree has a specific "persona" or target audience:
• BSCS (Computer Science): For the "highly technical folks" tackling logic and advanced math.
• BSGD (Software & Game Development): For the "gaming guru" with technical and creative chops.
• BSAAI (Applied AI & Data Engineering): For the "AI tinkerer" who can't get enough data.
• BSIS (Information Systems & Cybersecurity): For the "gearhead" or "tech troubleshooter".
• BSAIE (AI Engineering): For the "passionate problem solver" tackling complex real-world issues.
• BSSE (Software Engineering): For the "visionaries" building large-scale cloud systems.
6. Pedagogical Framework
Messaging around education must highlight the five phases of Project-Based Learning (PBL):
1. Introductory: Learning team methodologies.
2. Foundational: Small-scale projects in core labs.
3. Developmental: Integrating projects into virtually every course.
4. Capstone: A required individual "masterwork".
5. Enterprise: Real-world work for real employers.
